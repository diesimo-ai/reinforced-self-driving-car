# ai.py : the brain module of the car
# Description : AI for Self Driving Car
#
# Libraries requirements : 
#   <os> : standard library
#		- Provides a portable way of using operating system dependent functionality.
#   <sys> : standard library
#		- provides access to some variables used or maintained by the interpreter and 
#         to functions that interact strongly with the interpreter.
#   <random> : standard library
#		- Random variables generators
#   <numpy> : standard library
#		- Provides multidimensional arrays and linear algebra tools, optimized for speed
#   <torch> : Deep learning library
#		- Provides data structures for multi-dimensional tensors and defines mathematical operations over these tensors
#       - provides also many utilities for efficient serializing of Tensors and arbitrary types, and other useful utilities.
#       - It has a CUDA counterpart, that enables you to run your tensor computations on an NVIDIA GPU with compute capability >= 3.0.
#   <settings> : local module 
#       - provides parameters calibrations for model tuning
#       - provides config parameters and constant for the App
